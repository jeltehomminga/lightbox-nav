                  Standing near the spaceship, E.T.'s heart glows as he prepares
                  to return home. Mary, Gertie, and "Keys", a friendly
                  government agent, show up. E.T. says goodbye to Michael and
                  Gertie, as she presents him with the chrysanthemum that he had
                  revived. Before boarding the spaceship, he embraces Elliott
                  and tells him "I'll be right here", pointing his glowing
                  finger to Elliott's forehead. He then picks up the
                  chrysanthemum, boards the spaceship, and it takes off, leaving
                  a rainbow in the sky as everyone watches it leave.
