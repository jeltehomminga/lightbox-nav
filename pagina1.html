        Standing near the spaceship, E.T.'s heart glows as he prepares to return
        home. Mary, Gertie, and "Keys", a friendly government agent, show up.
        E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, as she presents him with the
        chrysanthemum that he had revived. Before boarding the spaceship, he
        embraces Elliott and tells him "I'll be right here", pointing his
        glowing finger to Elliott's forehead. He then picks up the
        chrysanthemum, boards the spaceship, and it takes off, leaving a rainbow
        in the sky as everyone watches it leave.
