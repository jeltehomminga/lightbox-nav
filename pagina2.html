                  Gordon Shumway is a Melmacian nicknamed ALF (an acronym for
                  Alien Life Form) by Willie Tanner in the pilot episode. ALF
                  was born on October 28, 1756, on the Lower East Side of the
                  planet Melmac. Melmac was located six parsecs past the
                  Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster, and had a green sky, blue grass
                  and a purple sun. The commonly-used currency is a "Wernick"
                  (named after producer Sandy Wernick), which is equal to 10
                  American dollars.
